# Inversion User's Guide

Inversion is a templating system for Ruby. It uses the Inversion of Control principle to decouple
the contents and structure of the template from the code that uses it, making it easier to use,
test-friendly, and clean.

[Getting Started](rdoc-ref:GettingStarted) goes over the requirements, installation, and basic usage of the library.

The rdoc-ref:Templates topic has more details about how to load templates and control their behavior with options.

When you're ready to start making your own templates, there's a quick-reference for the list of built-in rdoc-ref:Tags, too.

Finally, there are a number of [Annotated Examples](rdoc-ref:Examples) that illustrate how to solve common problems while templating.
