Here's a somewhat more complex example. At our company Spime-Thorpe from above, say we're creating a system that will handle mass layoffs without the need for management to handle all those messy personal interactions. We'll need a mass-mailer for the employees that will be afforded the chance to explore their career opportunities, right? So we create a template called @overboard-mail.tmpl@:

<?example { language: text, caption: "overboard-mail.tmpl" } ?>
Dear [?call employee.fullname ?],

Congratulations! You have been selected by [?call failed_company.name ?]'s
elite management team as one of the many lucky individuals that will
enjoy the exciting challenge of pursuing other rewarding employment
opportunities!

Kudos!

You will find your accounts have been disabled, your desk has been helpfully 
cleared out for you, and all of your personal effects packaged up and
delivered to your address of record:

[?call employee.address ?]

Please visit your customized Man OverBoard™ transition site immediately:

[?call config.overboard_url ?]/[?urlencode failed_company.id ?]/[?urlencode employee.id ?]

This will acknowledge that you have received this message, and automatically 
disable your email account.  Be sure and save this message!

[?if employee.severance_amount.nonzero? ?]
Failure to acknowledge this message could result in delay of your final 
severance pay, in the amount of [?call "$%0.2f" % employee.severance_amount ?].
[?else?]
Failure to acknowledge this message within 30 days will result in automatic forfeiture of your
numerous Man Overboard™ package benefits.
[?end?]
        
Good Luck,
Your friends at Spime-Thorpe, Inc!
